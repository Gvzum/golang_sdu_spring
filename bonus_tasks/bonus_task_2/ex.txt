Create a struct of Node, which will have two fields: value and pointer to the next node.
Create a LIFO struct (Stack) with all needed fields and methods implemented. Use the Node struct created at the previous step
DONâ€™ T FORGET ABOUT POINTERS TO THE INSTANCE IN METHODS


Methods of Stack struct:
Pop - delete the element from the top of the stack and return its value
Peek - return the value of the top element of the stack
Push - add new element to the top
Clear - remove all elements from the stack
Contains - return whether some element is inside of the stack
Increment - increment all elements of the stack by 1 (1 becomes 2, 5 becomes 6 etc.)
Print - print all elements, starting from the top
PrintReverse - print all elements, starting from the bottom

Your stack should consist of unique values which cannot be found in other codes
